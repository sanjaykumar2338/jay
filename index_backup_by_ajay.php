            <h2> Today's Options </h2>
            <p> The online college solutions out there now are cumbersome, and difficult to use. When you want to build your college list today, you typically go online, select your search criteria, and the database produces results. Then, you have to research the individual schools, see which ones you like, and try to figure out your chance of being accepted. Once that is done, you typically organize the list based on the likelihood of being admitted, and then develop a strategy for how many schools should be included on your list. This is time consuming, frustrating and hard to do. </p>
